        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p> Due to a series of poor decisions on my part I
            am unable to complete this project in time. I was 
            incorrect in my assessment of how much time this 
            project will take and thus waited until late sunday
            due to other family duties to complete it.
            I was unaware that I had simply completed the "easy" 
            portions in my 5 hour sprint on friday.</p>

            <p>At this point I have been unsecessful in getting 
            the requestes to the server despite an earlier version 
            having sent the data and returning a string. In my attempts to fix that I seem to have lost 
            how I was completeing that portion and am now unable to connect to my server at all.
            Needless to say I am incredably frustrated not only with my lack of understanding on this process 
            but with my inability to address the issue in a timely fashion.
